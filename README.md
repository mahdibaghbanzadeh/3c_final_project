## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Investigate the relationship between socioeconomic factors, such as income, education, poverty, and income inequality, and HIV prevalence.

- Analyze and visualize the data to identify patterns and insights.

- Provide a comprehensive understanding of the socioeconomic determinants of HIV prevalence in different counties across the U.S.
